# AI Testing Framework

An innovative testing framework that leverages AI to automate test case generation and execution. This framework is built using Java, Gradle, and Selenium WebDriver, providing a robust foundation for automated testing with AI capabilities.

## 🚀 Features

- **Thread-safe WebDriver Management**: Handles multiple browser instances safely
- **Page Object Model**: Implements best practices for maintainable test automation
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Supports Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific configuration handling
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging using SLF4J and Logback
- **Wait Mechanisms**: Smart wait implementations for better test stability
- **TestNG Integration**: Powerful test execution and reporting capabilities

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- Java 17
- Gradle
- Selenium WebDriver 4.18.1
- TestNG 7.9.0
- WebDriverManager 5.6.3
- Lombok
- SLF4J & Logback
